# Instrument music (mostly heavy stuff)

List for good VSTs and other stuff. Mainly for metal music. I try to keep this list minimal and to include just a couple tools per category to keep it simple. Also trying to lean more on easy hazzle-free downloads rather than heavy mailing-list+DRM shite, but some stuff are just too good...

Open for pull requests, but keep in mind I have a shitty taste in music

## Amps

### Ignite Amps, Emissary 

Free metal amp VST. No built-in cab emulations / IRs

https://www.igniteamps.com/#emissary

#### Black Rooster, Cybress TT-15

Good free Orange Tiny Terror -like amp. Has a good built-in IR. Pretty annoying download+install though.

## Saturation, tape emulation, effects

### iZotope Vinyl

Lo-Fi effects. Quite annoying download & install

## Things I would recommend to buy

Here is some plugins I have bought and which I would recommend

### Ugritone KVLT2 Drums

Drum emulation with more "oldschool" and rehearsal vibe. Really good sounds, but might be a bit buggy. Still well worth the money.

### Sketch Cassette 2

Awesome tape emulator. Can be used as an effect, saturator, compressor etc.
