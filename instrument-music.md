# Instrument music (mostly heavy stuff)

List for good VSTs and other stuff. Mainly for metal music. I try to keep this list minimal and to include just a couple tools per category to keep it simple. Also trying to lean more on easy hazzle-free downloads rather than heavy mailing-list+DRM overhead.

Open for pull requests, but keep in mind I have a shitty taste in music

## Amps

### Ignite Amps, Emissary 

Free metal amp VST. No built-in cab emulations / IRs

#### Black Rooster, Cybress TT-15

Good free Orange Tiny Terror -like amp. Has a good built-in IR. Pretty annoying download+install though.
