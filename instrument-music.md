# Instrument music - mostly for heavy stuff

List for good VSTs and other stuff. Mainly for metal music. I try to keep this list minimal and to include just a couple tools per category to keep it simple. Also trying to lean more on easy hazzle-free downloads rather than heavy mailing-list+DRM shite, but some stuff are just too good...

Open for pull requests, but keep in mind I have a shitty taste in music :--)

**What the hell are these??**

These are plugins you can use in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Usually your DAW has some built-in emulations and tools, but you can install more via VST plugins. 

My DAW of choice is [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/), but if youre looking for free/cheap DAW I would go for [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/).

## Amps

### Ignite Amps, Emissary 

Free metal amp VST. No built-in cab emulations / IRs

#### Black Rooster, Cybress TT-15

Good free Orange Tiny Terror -like amp. Has a good built-in IR. Pretty annoying download+install though.

## Compressors

### TDR Kotelnikov

A compressor. I admit I haven't used it that much yet, but I trust TDR!

### LoudMax 64

Dead simple but powerful compressor/limiter. Meant for mastering, but can be used on tracking as well. I usually put it in bass track

## Reverbs

### DragonFly Reverb

Good reverb with nice presets

### Voxengo, OldSkoolVerb

## Saturation, tape emulation, effects

### Saturation Knob

Awesome and simple tube saturator. Quite annoying download.

### iZotope Vinyl

Lo-Fi effects. Quite annoying download & install

### Polyverse Music Wider

A good stereo widener. I use this for widening the guitar track while doing quick sketches. That way you can get the drums & bass in the middle of the mix.

## Things I would recommend to buy

Here is some plugins I have bought and which I would recommend

### Ugritone KVLT2 Drums

Drum emulation with more "oldschool" and rehearsal vibe. Really good sounds, but might be a bit buggy. Still well worth the money.

### Sketch Cassette 2

Awesome tape emulator. Can be used as an effect, saturator, compressor etc.

### Mercurial Spark

Got it from -50% sale. Pretty awesome Marshall-like amp emulation with built-in cab emulation and some effects. Really easy and fast to get good sounds for metal.
