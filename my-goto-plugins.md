# My go-to plugins, instrumental

List of my go-to VST plugins. Mainly for heavier music. I try to keep this list minimal and to include just a couple tools per category to keep it simple. It will be updated when I find better and especially free tools.

**What the hell are these??**

These are plugins you can use in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Usually your DAW has some built-in emulations and tools, but you can install more via VST plugins. 

My DAW of choice is [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/), but if youre looking for free/cheap DAW I would go for [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/).

## Amps

### Neural Amp Modeler

Free open source software. This is a killer! Neural modeler amp with a lot of community made profiles. Can not stress enough how cool this one is!

## EQs

### TDR Nova

Used to be my goto EQ, but nowadays I only use this every now and then and mainly use the following PTEq-X.

### Ignite Amps, PTEq-X

Vintage tube EQ (Pultec) emulation. I have lately fell in love with this one. It's forgiving and broad EQ with HPF/LPF.

## Compressors

### LoudMax 64

Dead simple but powerful compressor/limiter. Meant for mastering, but can be used on tracking as well. I usually put it in bass track

## Reverbs

### DragonFly Reverb

Good reverb with nice presets

### Voxengo, OldSkoolVerb

## Saturation, tape emulation, effects

### Saturation Knob

Awesome and simple tube saturator. Quite annoying download.

### iZotope Vinyl

Lo-Fi effects. Quite annoying download & install

### Polyverse Music Wider

A good stereo widener. I use this for widening the guitar track while doing quick sketches. That way you can get the drums & bass in the middle of the mix.

### Chow Tape Model

Tape emulation. Easy install, no DRM.

## Non-free tools I can recommend

Here are some plugins I have bought and which I could recommend

### Ugritone KVLT2 Drums (or other ones)

Drum emulation with more "oldschool" and rehearsal vibe. Really good sounds, but might be a bit buggy. Still well worth the money. I also have the doom and the punk drums and I like them a lot as well.

### Sketch Cassette 2

Awesome tape emulator. Can be used as an effect, saturator, compressor etc.
